# Financial-network-analysis-python
This assignment aims to perform the steps required for financial network analysis using a real dataset.

Financial markets are well-defined complex systems formed from many enterprises, institutions, and individuals. The rationality behind this statement is that the performance of certain stocks is often correlated, either because of the general market direction or the cyclicality of the same segments of the market. 

Due to this, in this assignment, we will use network analytics to identify groups (communities) of densely connected nodes to guarantee that our investment portfolio is reliable. 

In this assignment, we will use a network where nodes correspond to stock prices and edges represent correlations among prices variations. 

To avoid intricate data scrapping, correlations have been already computed using the Yahoo Finance service. The data extracted corresponds to the period from 2019 Jan 1st till July 2020 for all stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ.
